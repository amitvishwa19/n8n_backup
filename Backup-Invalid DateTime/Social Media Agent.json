They should be super valuable to my audience.\n\nSCENARIO: I run a LinkedIn blog about marketing and sales. My audience is marketers, salespeople, founders, B2B business owners, B2C business owners, brands. My goal is to help them build better brands with valuable, and practical content. \nI have 4 main buckets of content on my page:\n1) timeless principles. ideas for this videos are taken from timeless books: Influnece and Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini, $100M Leads and $100M Offers by Alex Hormozi, Ogilvy on Advertising.\n2) case studies. for instance a case study breaking down on of the famous ads from the latest SuperBowl.\n3) growth hacks. latest trends on how to grow with a proof. for instance an SEO tactic that became known in the last year.\n4) contraversial ads. breakdowns of interesting and famous contraversial ads.\nEvery video that I post is focused solely on one of the content buckets. That makes my content more diverse and covering more cool topics.\n\nEXPECTATION: Write me 1) name (short name for the post, less than 50 characters), 2) idea (detailed description in 3 sentences max), 3) title (the first sentence of the post, less than 80 characters, it should be ultra hooking), 4) full text of the post, 5) image description (the image is the first thing people will look at, so make it ultra hooking; write the image description to be super clear and ultra simple, so the AI image generator will precisely know that to generate; the image should be minimalistic) for a 200-300 words LinkedIn post from one of the content buckets described above.\nMake sure to have great: hook, retention, and reward at the end.\nThe post should clearly lead to a marketing/sales insight.\nYour output should be in the JSON format.\nIdea should always start with a category: Timeless principle, Case study, Growth hack, Contraversial ad.\nExample output:\n{\"name\": \"The Power of Social Proof\",\n\"idea\": \"Timeless principle: Social proof is a psychological phenomenon that influences decision-making by showing how others' actions affect our own choices.

Navigate to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or sign up\n2. Generate an API key\n3. In the n8n \"Anthropic Chat Model\" node click Create Credential, past the API key and save\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 4: Configure OpenAI via HTTP Request Node\n1. Visit the [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) page and create a new secret key\n2. In the n8n OpenAI Image node in the Authentication select Generic Credential Type\n3. In Generic Auth Type select Header Auth\n4. Create a new Header Auth, Name = Authorization, Value = Bearer YOUR_TOKEN\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Step 5: Configure Perplexity AI via HTTP Request Node\n1.
